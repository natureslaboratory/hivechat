The influence of the used solvent for extraction on the tested activity and the chemical composition was also investigated.

Standardized propolis products with consistent bioactive properties are now available, a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AFÂ®).

Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. We enrolled 124 patients in total.

(13, 7, 1, 'Text', '{\"content\":\"<p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic progressive &nbsp;disease characterized by chronic fasting hyperglycemia and resulting in &nbsp;defective insulin action. This pathology is most often linked to life &nbsp;style changes, obesity, physical inactivity and family antecedents. &nbsp;Currently, its incidence is increasing exponentially, and affects more &nbsp;than 350 million people worldwide, estimates are that it will grow to &nbsp;about 642 million people by 2040. Several hypotheses were put in place &nbsp;in order to explain the mechanisms involved in the manifestation of &nbsp;diabetes and its associated risks. The most solid one is that linking to &nbsp;oxidative stress, in fact hyperglycemia is a main factor triggering &nbsp;oxidative stress via the overproduction of reactive oxygen species &nbsp;(ROS). The relationship between diabetes, hepato-renal damage and &nbsp;oxidative stress has been the subject of previous studies. Nature is an &nbsp;inexhaustible source of products and bioactive molecules that can be &nbsp;used as alternative treatments, being propolis one of them. Propolis, &nbsp;known as a miracle drug, is a sticky, resinous substance made by a &nbsp;complex mixture of bee-released and plantâ€“derived compounds. Numerous &nbsp;studies have shown that propolis has different therapeutic properties &nbsp;such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anticancer, &nbsp;antiangiogenic and hepatoprotective. Furthermore, in vitro studies have &nbsp;shown that propolis inhibits ?-amylase and ? -glucosidase activities as &nbsp;part of its anti-hyperglycemic mechanism . Pollen is another bee product &nbsp;that is extremely rich in bioactive molecules, like flavonoids. &nbsp;Numerous biological effects are attributed to bee pollen, which include &nbsp;antioxidant , cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory &nbsp;effects. Honey have antioxydant and antiinflammatory properties, honey &nbsp;decreases urinary prostaglandins and increases nitric oxyde. Until now, &nbsp;no study had examined the combined effect of propolis and bee pollen or &nbsp;honey on type 2 diabetes and its related metabolic disorders. Therefore, &nbsp;the aim of this study was to determine the chemical composition of &nbsp;antioxidant polyphenols in propolis, bee pollen and honey extracts and &nbsp;also to evaluate the influence of several doses of these extracts and &nbsp;their mixture in the prevention of T2D, dyslipidemia and hepato-renal &nbsp;dysfunction induced by D-glucose in rats. The results of this study &nbsp;showed for the first time that co-administration of propolis and honey &nbsp;or bee pollen extracts, especially their combination, are able to &nbsp;attenuate the T2D caused by a high-glucose intake. The role of these &nbsp;natural ingredients involves prevention of hyperglycemia, insulinemia, &nbsp;HOMA-IR index, HOMA-?, Insulin sensitivity, pancreatic ?-cell function &nbsp;and lipid prolife. Furthermore, these natural products ameliorate &nbsp;hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity as diabetic complications.</p>\\n<p>It might be concluded that propolis , honey and pollen are potential &nbsp;candidates to be used in the management of diabetes and its metabolic &nbsp;disorders .

A company in Yorkshire think theyâ€™ve identified a solution to &nbsp;the problem of antibiotic resistance.
